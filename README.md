## Notes
* These configuration files assume that the target system is running Arch Linux.
* Does not include system-wide configurations.

## WIP:
* Personal bootstrapping script, if I ever feel like it.
* Set up YouCompleteMe for VIM (and possibly a few other plugins).
* Finish configuring tmux.
* Experiment with awesomewm, bspwm and/or dwm/xmonad, when I'm in the mood to break things.
